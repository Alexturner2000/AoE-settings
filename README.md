- **Select all Villagers**  `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `V`
- **Select all Military** `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A`
### Important for my strategy
I made these super easy to hit, which makes macroing a lot easier
- **Select all cavalry** `Q`
- **Select all melee** `W`
- **Select all ranged** `E`
- **Select all siege** `R`
### Control groups
All default, except I moved control group 0 to control group `~`
### Building selection
- Select al military production buildings `F1`
- Select all economy buildings `F2`
- Select all technology buildings `F3`
- Select all landmarks/wonders/capital Town Centers `F4`
- Cycle through Town Centers `Spacebar`
- Focus on Capital Town Center `H`

## My strategy
Assign `4` to my Town Centers to make training villagers equal and constant
Assign `~` to scouts
Assign `1-3` different war fronts and use tab or DoubleClick to micro on that front
